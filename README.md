# [notneelpatel.github.io](https://notneelpatel.github.io)

My personal website consisting of blog posts, projects, and other HTML/CSS/JS web development ideas.

This website is an extension of me. If you're an employer looking to see my skills, please take a look at [my projects](https://notneelpatel.github.io/projects) and my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/notneelpatel).

## Built from Scratch

All the HTML and CSS was written by me. No JS libraries were used. The blog engine (converting .md files to html blog posts and also updating RSS feed and site links) was written in Python by me as well.
