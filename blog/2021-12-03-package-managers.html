      <h2>Package Managers Will Change Your Life</h2>
      <h3>2021-12-03</h3>
      <p>
        How do you go about installing programs normally on your computer? Do
        you use an app store? Do you download the installation file on a
        website? While both of those methods are definitely viable, I'm going to
        introduce you to the best way to install apps: Using a package manager.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a package manager?</h3>
      <p>
        Package managers allow you to install packages of apps, programs, and
        other data, such as dependencies for programs. Their main purpose are to
        install, remove, and update anything on your system. The package manager
        system is actually exactly what is used in programs like the app/play
        store on smartphones. With these apps, you're able to manage most/all
        your apps. Traditional package managers are usually terminal-based
        though.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples of package managers:</h3>
      <p>
        If you've programmed before, you've probably used some language-based
        package managers, such as pip (python) or npm (javascript). You can do
        stuff like this to install any dependencies for you programs.
      </p>
      <p><code>pip install &lt;package&gt;</code></p>
      <p><code>npm install &lt;package&gt;</code></p>
      <p>
        What may be more helpful for the "average" user are the OS-based package
        managers. On Linux, there are hundreds, but the two most commonly used
        are: apt (on Debian and Ubuntu-based systems), and pacman (on Arch-based
        systems). They can also be used to do things like updates. What's nice
        about that is that you can continue using your computer as it's being
        handled by your package manager which is awesome.
      </p>
      <p>Examples of installing packages:</p>
      <p>Apt:</p>
      <p><code>sudo apt-get install &lt;package&gt;</code></p>
      <p>Pacman:</p>
      <p><code>sudo pacman -S &lt;package&gt;</code></p>
      <p>Examples of updating packages/system:</p>
      <p>Apt:</p>
      <p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>
      <p><code>sudo apt upgrade</code></p>
      <p>Pacman:</p>
      <p><code>sudo pacman -Syu</code></p>
      <p>
        Installing packages like this is also possible using powershell and
        winget on Windows. Winget is developed by Microsoft, so it's fairly
        limited. I'd highly suggest installing chocolatey as well to be able to
        install more apps and programs.
      </p>
      <p><code>winget install &lt;author.package&gt;</code></p>
      <p><code>choco install &lt;package&gt;</code></p>
      <p>
        *Make sure you're running powershell as an admin when using chocolatey
      </p>
      <h3>Why you should care</h3>
      <p>
        Using winget and chocolatey on Windows really made my experience so much
        better. Instead of opening chromium and searching for the Spotify,
        Discord, and other applications, I was able to just open the windows
        terminal and
      </p>
      <p><code>winget install Discord.Discord</code></p>
      <p>and</p>
      <p><code>winget install Spotify.Spotify</code></p>
      <p>
        I didn't have to deal with the setup.exe or anything. The apps just
        opened after a few seconds after, just like as if I installed them from
        the Microsoft Store. It's quick, efficient, and you look cool when you
        do it. All it took me to do this was a simple command in the terminal.
        Using the terminal in general is something that is really useful,
        especially when installing programs, as it will often tell you exactly
        what's wrong with the program if you need to troubleshoot it. It's
        always more useful than getting some random numbered error and a very
        ambigious dialog box. Just don't be like Linus Tech Tips and read the
        message before nuking your desktop environment haha.
