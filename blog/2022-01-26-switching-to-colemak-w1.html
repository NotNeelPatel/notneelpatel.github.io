<h2>Using The Colemak Keyboard Layout - Week 1</h2>
<h3>2022-01-26</h3>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Why not? While QWERTY works perfectly for me right now, I want to challenge myself to use a different layout to prove to myself that I am capable.</p>
<h3>My Journey Thus Far</h3>
<p>I started about a week ago, and to raise the stakes, I challenged my friend Nathaniel to do the same. I stuck with QWERTY for work, but whenever I wasn't in a rush, I used Colemak. Switching layouts is really easy as I have a simple shortcut for the layouts. This way, if someone needs to use my PC, they can use it without going through the pain.</p>
<p>My first few attempts went terribly as expected. I had the layout overlaid over Monkeytype so that I could see it without having to change any keycaps or anything.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/8wpm.png" alt="8 wpm w/ keyboard" width="100%" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, I was able to type around 10 wpm on average.</p>
<p>The next day, I tried typing without the layout overlaid, and achieved 14 wpm. Every day, I would practice on Monkeytype for at least 15 minutes and would increase my wpm little by little. At this point, Nathaniel and I were neck and neck. But at 3 am on Monday, he managed to go from 24 wpm to 35 wpm, and during the day, he achieved 45 wpm. To clarify, he is better at typing than me; his QWERTY speed is about 95 wpm vs. my 75. Despite that, he and I were shocked. I tried to catch up, and even today, I have yet to reach him. On the bright side, I can now average around 30 wpm, and my personal best is 41 wpm.</p>

<h3>Goals For Next Week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Achieve a new PB of at least 50 wpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average 40 wpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Colemak casually more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*By the way I wrote all this in Colemak and it took ~30 min</p>  </div>
