      <h2>Using The Colemak Keyboard Layout - Week 1</h2>
      <h3>2022-01-26</h3>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Why not? While QWERTY works perfectly for me right now, I want to
        challenge myself to use a different layout to prove to myself that I am
        capable.
      </p>
      <h2>My Journey Thus Far</h2>
      <p>
        I started about a week ago, and to raise the stakes, I challenged my
        friend Nathaniel to do the same. I stuck with QWERTY for work but
        whenever I wasn't in a rush, I used colemak. Switching layouts is really
        easy as I have a simple shortcut for the layouts. This way, if someone
        needs to use my PC they can use it without going through the pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first few attempts went terrible as expected. I had the layout
        overlayed over monkeytype so that I can see without having to change any
        keycaps or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../assets/images/8wpm.png"
          alt="8 wpm w/ keyboard"
          width="100%"
          loading="lazy"
        />
      </p>
      <p>After about 30 mins, I was able to type around 10 wpm on average.</p>
      <p>
        The next day, I tried typing without the layout overlayed, and achieved
        14 wpm. Everyday I would practice on monkeytype for at least 15 mins and
        would increase my wpm little by little. At this point, Nathaniel and I
        were neck and neck. But at 3 am on Monday he managed to go from 24 wpm
        to 35 wpm, and during the day he achieved 45 wpm. To clarify, he is
        better at typing than me; his QWERTY speed is about 95 wpm vs. my 75.
        Despite that, he and I were shocked. I tried to catch up and even today,
        I have yet to reach him. On the bright side, I can now average around 30
        wpm, and my personal best is 41 wpm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../assets/images/41wpm.png"
          alt="41 wpm"
          width="100%"
          loading="lazy"
        />
      </p>
      <h2>Goals For Next Week:</h2>
      <p>-Achieve a new PB of at least 50 wpm</p>
      <p>-Average 40 wpm</p>
      <p>-Use Colemak casually more</p>
      <p>*By the way I wrote all this in Colemak and it took ~30 min</p>
