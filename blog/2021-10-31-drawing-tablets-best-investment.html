      <h2>Drawing Tablets - The Best Investment for Students</h2>
      <h3>2021-10-31</h3>
      <h3>1. Draw and Annotate PDFs</h3>
      <p>
        It saves on printing anything and all you need to do is download pdfs of
        any lecture powerpoints and use a program like
        <a href="https://xournalpp.github.io">Xournal++</a> (or OneNote for
        Windows users)
      </p>
      <h3>2. Easy to Screenshot/Save Files</h3>
      <p>
        If you are taking any online tests where you need to show work, this
        will be a life saver as you can just save a file as a PDF and directly
        submit it without having the pain of taking a picture and converting it
        to a PDF.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Flexibility with Software vs Paper</h3>
      <p>
        There is no need to worry about eraser residue or missing any part of a
        lecture if you're running out of space as you can move, scale, and erase
        as much as you would like. Copying parts of equations and drawings as
        well as taking screenshots of the teacher's notes and pasting them into
        my own notes is really easy and fast. Overall, there's significantly
        more efficiency.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Alternative to iPad + Apple Pencil</h3>
      <p>
        Drawing tablets can do more or less the same thing that iPads and Apple
        Pencils can do, but for significantly cheaper. On top of that, it's
        really only practical to have an iPad as your main machine where you
        store your files or you need to have a MacBook to use AirPlay to send
        files seamlessly. You can easily get a cheap drawing tablet and a laptop
        for the price of an iPad and Apple Pencil or a MacBook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, drawing tablets have the benefits of using a computer and the
        benefits of using a pen and paper. You can also do art with them
        <em>(what a surprise!!!)</em>. While I don't do art, it is great
        whenever I need to do some quick sketches or image manipulation on GIMP.
        As someone who plays osu!, I have to mention that you can marginally
        improve with a tablet over a mouse, but don't expect to be the best in
        the world because of it. You can honestly get any drawing tablet on
        Amazon or wherever (as long as it isn't the cheapest one. I would
        recommend looking for one that's at least $40+ CAD).
