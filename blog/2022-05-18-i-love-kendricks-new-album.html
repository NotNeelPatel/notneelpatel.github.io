      <h2>I Love Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</h2>
      <h3>2022-05-18</h3>
      <p>
        Before I get into the album, I must talk about the website. Seeing
        <a href="https://oklama.com/nuthoughts">oklama.com</a> for the first
        time last year started the rollout of the album. Such a simple website,
        yet I loved it. The black background and the font (in nu thoughts) was
        the inspiration for the layout of this website. By then I was already
        unhappy with parts of my old layout but seeing that simple website was
        the nail in the coffin. Unfortunately, it seems like the website wasn't
        used to its full potential. There was unused things like a page full of
        folders and a grid of folders where in each there was a black folder.
        Upon clicking on any of the folders, it led to a 404 page. I think it
        would've been interesting to see more features added but at the same
        time I like the simplicity of the website. It seems like a very
        interesting concept and it also allows us to get the information from
        the one reputable source rather than social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting into the album, I had the opportunity to listen to the majority
        of it with my friends, Michael and Andrew. We were all pretty tired so
        the first listen through was just getting a feeling of how the album was
        like. When I listened to it again the next morning, I started to see the
        bigger picture and really started to see the intricacies of the album.
      </p>
      <p>Some key takeaways from the album that I think should be clear are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          -Part I: Big Steppers has Kendrick talk about struggles but from a
          distance, as if he's stepping around (symbolized by tap dancing)
        </li>
        <li>
          -Part II: Mr. Morale is Kendrick opening up about his wrongs and
          telling the audience what he truly feels
        </li>
        <li>
          -The album is written like a play. This goes back to the theory of how
          all Kendrick albums are different forms of media (S.80: Book, GKMC:
          Movie, TPAB: Poetry, DAMN: Magazine)
        </li>
        <li>-The setting of this play is his thoughts as he is in therapy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of what I've been thinking has been expressed by critics and
        reviewers, so I don't have much to add.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favourite lines on one of my favourite tracks, Mother I Sober,
        is "you ain't felt grief/guilt 'til you felt it sober". This line
        alludes to his song, "u", where he's blaming himself for many problems
        while he's drunk in a hotel room. u is a very heart-wrenching song and
        to hear him say that only highlights the amount of emotional pain stored
        in him after all these years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember hearing Auntie Diaries and being very conflicted on his usage
        of the "f-bomb". This song reminded me of another song I once heard
        called "Woman is the (n word) of the World", written in 1972 by John
        Lennon of the Beatles. The song is about the unfair treatment of women
        in the world, similar to the way black people were treated in America at
        the time. Today, if John Lennon was still alive, he would most
        definitely not be able to perform it in the same way it was performed in
        the 70s. I think Kendrick is trying to do the same thing. It doesn't
        take long for you to see that the f word is used quite liberally in hip
        hop, however, a lot of people are simply ignorant (or as Kendrick said,
        "we ain't know better"). This song isn't for the LGBTQ+ community. It's
        for those who don't know. If wasn't for this song, I wouldn't have known
        what deadnaming was, so I think the song is doing it's job very well in
        terms of educating others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I get to my favourite parts of the album, I want to mention that
        I didn't love everything. There were many flows and bars that I just
        didn't like. For example, the first verse of N95 where he says "Take
        off" over 10 times in a row, or when he rhymed brother with brother 7
        times in a row in the third verse of Rich Spirit. Die Hard is probably
        my least favourite track in the album. Nothing about the singing,
        verses, or production piques my interest whatsover. The same can be said
        about the interludes, but they're interludes after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no particular order, my favourite tracks are Father Time, Mother I
        Sober, United in Grief, and Auntie Diaries. Father Time is already a
        classic storytelling type song. It reminds me of DUCKWORTH. Auntie
        Diaries and Mother I Sober both start slow and build up musically. I
        think I'm just a sucker for this type of music, with a slow buildup and
        a beautiful climax with strings. This leads to why I love United in
        Grief. The drums, piano, strings, and 80's synth is so simple yet so
        effective. It just goes to show the effectiveness of dynamics (volume)
        in music is. It's something that I think is quite overlooked but in
        these tracks especially, we can see just how important it is to this
        album.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time I hear these tracks, I feel extremely motivated. I want to
        create something. I want to make something beautiful, something as
        amazing as United in Grief, but I feel like I'm in this creative block
        that I can't escape. I have ideas but they all feel half-baked. I want
        to make YouTube videos; I have the time, resources and skills to make a
        video but the most important aspect of making YouTube videos is missing.
        I want to feel like Kendrick at the end of the album, but it feels like
        I'm still in the Steppers half. Sure, I still have ~3.5 months left
        before I have school again but I also know life happens and things are
        only going to get harder as summer break continues. Maybe I'm just too
        ambitious. To be fair, the last three weeks have been pretty productive:
        I added many features to my "blog engine" and to this website, I made
        Wallpaper Theme Converter, and I also have been working a bit at my job.
        Despite that, I'm still very hungry to do more.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, Kendrick's latest album is not his best work. He didn't make
        the album we all wanted. He didn't make an album that focused on issues
        that have been happening since 2017. He didn't make an album that will
        be played on the radio or in barber shops. What he did instead was make
        an album that came straight from his heart. I love this album. The
        production is simply beautiful. Some might get tired of its repetition
        or its lack of timbral changes and overuse of piano and strings, but I
        love it. I enjoy hearing the music build up as I get deeper in the track
        as more layers are added. It was amazing hearing Kendrick's progression
        as he shares his insecurities and doubts to millions across the world. I
        don't really relate to any of the tracks yet I can't help but enjoy
        hearing his insight and listening to his growth. This album is pushing
        me to do better and to be better. I want to make my own Mr. Morale and
        the Big Steppers to be proud of. Wish me luck as I continue to look for
        ideas.
