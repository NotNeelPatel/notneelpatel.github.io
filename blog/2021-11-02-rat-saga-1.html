      <h2>The Rat Saga, Pt.1</h2>
      <h3>2021-11-02</h3>
      <h3>Time Frame: July 2021 - October 2021</h3>
      <p>
        It was some time around July of 2021, when I went to bed and started
        hearing tapping sounds from the ceiling. I immediately knew what was
        happening: there's some kind of rodent (which from now on, I'll refer to
        as a rat) in between the floor of the first floor and the ceiling of the
        basement.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not <em>that</em> big of a deal when you hear the occasional
        scutter, but when you're tired and trying to get a good night's rest,
        it's a major pain. I'd constantly hear metal clanging and scurrying
        around throughout the night to a point that I started playing music to
        drown out the sound a little.
      </p>
      <p>Before you give me advice, there are a few things that I've tried:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>-Placing traps</p>
        <p>
          -High-pitched sounds (This was especially ineffective because I can
          still hear them too)
        </p>
        <p>-Peppermint oil</p>
        <p>
          -Any attempt to catch it using peanut butter, cheese, and other lures
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It's really hard to really do anything about the rat considering my
        basement's ceiling area is as large as the house's footprint. The other
        problem is morals. As my mom doesn't want to kill the rat, mutilating it
        is unfortunately not an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rat seems to only be using the house as a shelter (foreshadowing).
        This is kind of nice as I don't have to worry about the food stored in
        the basement or anything like that. However, there was one thing that
        was odd that happened. My ethernet cable (which comes from the ceiling
        of the basement) randomly stopped working one day. I have no reason not
        the believe that the rat did it, especially considering I know they're
        capable of destroying wires (happened to this logitech speaker set that
        was in the basement a few years ago).
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day, I have not seen the rat with my eyes, and the proof that I
        have is the rat's poop.
      </p>
