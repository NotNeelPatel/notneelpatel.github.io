      <h2>Dealing With Scammers</h2>
      <h3>2022-03-04</h3>
      <p>
        Recently I've been getting lots of phone calls from scammers. The call
        starts with an automated message from "Service Canada" and that there's
        something wrong with your social security number. By pressing 1, you can
        talk with one of the "Service Canada" employees to get the issue solved.
        However, upon pressing 1, you will be met by an Indian probably living
        in Gurugram.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to have fun with these scammers because I don't mind ruining
        the days and wasting the time of evil people. Heres how the call usually
        goes:
      </p>
      <div id="centerText">
        <p><strong>Scammer:</strong> Service Canada, how may I help you?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Me:</strong> I have a question. Are your parents proud of you,
          considering all you do is scam for a living?
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That always prompts the scammer to hang up. I've only done it a handful
        of times but they keep calling regardless. By the 3rd or 4th time, all I
        had to say was "I have a question" and I can hear the scammer rage.
        Today, all I said was "Hey" and this time it was a different voice, yet
        still they responded with "shut up" and hung up. It seems like I've made
        a name for myself in that call centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly exposing the fact that these people's parents probably hate them
        makes them so insecure. If you recieve a call like this, just mention
        how their parents aren't proud of them and they will get extremely
        annoyed. When they're in a bad mood, it affects their performance, so
        they'll likely make more mistakes and get more frustrated when talking
        to the unfortunate bunch who fell for the scam. Hopefully the fact that
        the scammer is yelling at them is enough for them to realize that it's a
        scam.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an Indian myself, I'm greatly dissappointed in the lows some of these
        people have gone to steal money from vulnerable people. The best thing
        we can do is educate our youth and elderly, and remind the scammers that
        their parents are just as dissappointed as I am in them.
