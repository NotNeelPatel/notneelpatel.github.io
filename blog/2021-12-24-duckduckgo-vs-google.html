      <h2>DuckDuckGo - Just for Privacy?</h2>
      <h3>2021-12-24</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since Google dominated the search engine market share (they even
        own the 2nd largest search engine, YouTube), it seems like it's the
        obvious choice. However, you've probably heard of DuckDuckGo, the
        privacy-focused search engine. While yes, it does have many
        privacy-respecting features, I personally believe that it actually has
        some benefits over Google.
      </p>
      <h3>Customization</h3>
      <p>
        As a fan of making everything look somewhat uniform, I love how I can
        adjust how DuckDuckGo looks like. I can change the background colour,
        font, colours of the text, and much more. Google's theme is honestly not
        bad, but I never liked its dark mode and it isn't nearly as customizable
        as DDG.
      </p>
      <h3>Bang Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        Simply by typing ![shortcut], I can directly search from a specified
        website. For example,
      </p>
      <p>Wikipedia: !w</p>
      <p>Google: !g</p>
      <p>Reddit: !reddit</p>
      <p>Stack Overflow: !stackoverflow</p>
      <p>etc.</p>
      <p>
        This feature is not exclusive to DDG; you can do this in pretty much
        every browser, but you would need to manually add them.
      </p>
      <h3>App</h3>
      <p>
        Having switched to the app on Android, I find it to be faster than
        Chrome, and it has this nice feature that it doesn't save your search
        history. No more incognito searches, since it's always in incognito
        mode. Any data stored can easily be wiped with a press of a button as
        well. It's super clean and minimal as well.
      </p>
      <h3>But Google gives better and more relevant search results!</h3>
      <p>
        This is the one and only reason why Google is arguably the best search
        engine. The answer you're looking for will almost always be there.
        Google will actively censor and block search suggestions and results,
        which has its pros and cons. Google will also use the data that it's
        been collecting on you through maps, Gmail, YouTube, the play store, and
        your search history to deliver the most relevant search result to you.
        To be honest, sometimes Google knowing exactly what I mean when I search
        for something is very useful, so I can simply use the !g shortcut to
        search through Google for that, and go back to using DDG for other
        searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        For programming syntax, DuckDuckGo is significantly better though. In
        the search result, you will often see code snippets from Stack Overflow
        which is really helpful.
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Google is the least privacy-respecting search engine. It is crazy how
        much Google knows about you, and even if you turn on all of Google's
        privacy "respecting" features, it will continue to track your data in
        other ways. While there isn't anything for me to hide really, I like how
        DDG respects me as a person both for my privacy but also the devs
        understand that DDG is a piece of software that I can control. Sure, it
        doesn't have the machine learning capabilities of Google, but as I
        mentioned, Google is just a !bang shortcut away.
      </p>
      <h3>More Customization and Privacy?</h3>
      <p>
        searX is an even more private search engine that you should look into.
        Instead of having dedicated servers, you can host your own search engine
        server and aggregate search results from multiple search engines.
        Eventually, I will try to make my own search engine with searX, but I
        still have a ways to go before I dip my toes in that.
