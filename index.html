                    <p>Currently this website is a work in progress. Some of the goals I have for this website is: blog posts, resume, youtube videos (let's hope I get this far!), and other stuff people normally host on their personal websites. I also really hate loading screens so the other big thing I want to make sure is that this website is super lightweight. This means no useless javascript fluff. Quite a lot of work, especially considering I don't know anything about HTML and CSS and all the code that I used for this website is using inspect element on other websites and borrowing their code (not really, it's more for inspiration). See you soon!</p>
